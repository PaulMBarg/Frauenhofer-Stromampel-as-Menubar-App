# Frauenhofer Stromampel in macOS in Menubar

## Current Status: Concept | Work not even in Progress.

I would like create a fast and always avaiable access to the ["Stromampel" Energy Charts by Fraunhofer ISE](https://www.energy-charts.info/charts/consumption_advice/chart.htm?l=de&c=DE).
That way one can always see the share of renewable energy at a glance. The user can react on this information 
by for example not doing the laundry if the traffic light is red. In a more scientic usecase a user can 
wait to send computation heavy jobs to a cluster, if the results are not urgent. 

I do know that Apple already provides a widget with the same functionaly (showing share of renewable energy in the power grid) but it is not active in Germany right now.
